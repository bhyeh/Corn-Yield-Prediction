# Cornell-Corn-Yield-Prediction

## Repository Description ##
A very **_brief_** showcase of my ongoing research and work @ Cornell's Nutrient Management Spear Program (NMSP) and their Digital Agriculture initiative. If you are interested in hearing more details about my work or obtaining a preprint, please feel free to reach out to me @ **by253@cornell.edu**! 

## Research Objective ##
Within-field yield measurements obtained by yield monitor systems can offer powerful insight into improving allocation of crop inputs and farm resources. However, existing yield monitor systems are expensive, data collection is tedious requiring delicate calibration, and post-harvest data cleaning is a laborious effort as well. The objective of my research is to evaluate whether corn grain and silage yield can be efficiently estimated from high resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery in combination with various neural network architectures. 
  
## Data Collection ##
During the growing season of 2019, a Quantix™ hybrid drone and AeroVironment Decision Support System™ (AeroVironment Inc.) collected weekly color (RGB) and multispectral
(RG-NIR) images of various fields over the span of approximately 14 weeks. In total, eight farms were captured (three grain, five silage; 420 acres total). In addition to the images obtained from the Quantix drone, weather and terrain elevation data were further sourced in constructing a dataset to model and learn from. With modeling, the specific goal is to map the temporal relationship between weekly drone images, weather measurements, as well as static regional features (digital elevation and landform classes) to the end of harvest yield.
